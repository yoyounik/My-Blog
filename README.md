# My-Daily-Blog ðŸš€
**Note - All the project repositories are available on github**

Lets talk about the projects <br>
1. Project 1- MuseSnapðŸŽ¼ - Music app - where you can upload screenshots of any random musician - which you saw on instagram reels<br> or shorts,
   the AI (for now imagga API) will help you recognize the musician and recommend you their playlist (used another API).
2. Project 2- Gen AI image generation using pytorch - this project is one of my biggest project to start off with GEN AI , understanding<br>
   the generator and discriminator and all about how they have neural networks which can be used to generate image.
3. Project 3 - Working on full stack real time chatting app using websocket - backend work going on....
   Update -  Created Rest APIs for chat room and testing them using POSTMAN - facing lombok error and trying my best to resolve it asap.
   Tomorrow - learning websockets.

5. Then there were many other projects which i worked on - especially OLLAMA - which was used to run LLMs locally on my machine and <br>
   generate response on how to build a god resume in my AI Resume builder project.


**TechStack used this Year** 
1. Backend - Spring Boot - Java,
2. Frontend - React JS + VITE, Tailwind CSS
3. CI/CD - Docker, Kubernetes
4. Database - MongoDB, SQL
5. Language - Python, How to design a generator and discriminator - in short a neural network - which can be used anywhere.

**Hackathon**
Participated in HackFrost 2024, came in the top 20 members for the Hackfrost promotional event on twitter and linkedin.


**Java Revision**
1. Created immutable class in java - asked in interviews , immutable means - its value cannot be changed.

Note- As you can see in the image the changed value of id is not shown - it prooves the immutability in java class created.

2. Got to know how thread scheduler works and all about premptive and non premptive scheduling algorithm:<br>

3. Daemon Thread - It is a service provider thread for the user thread.
   Two most important methods in it: <br>

   <br>

   #Real life example of daemon thread:<br>
   1.1 Auto-Save feature in Document Editor. <br>
   1.2 In document editor application like MS Word or Google Docs, an auto-save feature is oftern implemented. <br>
   1.3 here main is the user thread, and setDaemon in main marks the thread as daemon thread. <br>
   1.4 Auto save happens as long as the main(user) thread is alive.<br>
   1.5 Once main (user) thread ends, the JVM also terminates the daemon thread. <br>

   <b>code for Auto Saving documents: <br>

Strings - 1 Medium - Zigzag conversion

**Docker**
1. Created custom images and ran container based on it.
2. Images are Read Only , learnt about different layers of images.
3. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57362f03-c723-4906-ad11-aead34574955)

**GEN AI**
1. Revised basics of python - tuples, dictionaly, OOP's concept.
2. Learnt about packages and modules in python , then got to know how to create custom packages and also learnt about streamlit and how you can use it to develop web application so fast.
