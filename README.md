**Note - All the project repositories are available on github**

Lets talk about the projects <br>
1. Project 1- MuseSnapðŸŽ¼ - Music app - where you can upload screenshots of any random musician - which you saw on instagram reels<br> or shorts,
   the AI (for now imagga API) will help you recognize the musician and recommend you their playlist (used another API).
2. Project 2- Gen AI image generation using pytorch - this project is one of my biggest project to start off with GEN AI , understanding<br>
   the generator and discriminator and all about how they have neural networks which can be used to generate image.

3. Then there were many other projects which i worked on - especially OLLAMA - which was used to run LLMs locally on my machine and <br>
   generate response on how to build a god resume in my AI Resume builder project.
