**Note - All the project repositories are available on github**

Lets talk about the projects <br>
1. Project 1- MuseSnapðŸŽ¼ - Music app - where you can upload screenshots of any random musician - which you saw on instagram reels<br> or shorts,
   the AI (for now imagga API) will help you recognize the musician and recommend you their playlist (used another API).
2. Project 2- Gen AI image generation using pytorch - this project is one of my biggest project to start off with GEN AI , understanding<br>
   the generator and discriminator and all about how they have neural networks which can be used to generate image.
3. Project 3 - Working on full stack real time chatting app using websocket - backend work going on....

4. Then there were many other projects which i worked on - especially OLLAMA - which was used to run LLMs locally on my machine and <br>
   generate response on how to build a god resume in my AI Resume builder project.


**TechStack used this Year** 
1. Backend - Spring Boot - Java,
2. Frontend - React JS + VITE, Tailwind CSS
3. CI/CD - Docker, Kubernetes
4. Database - MongoDB, SQL
5. Language - Python, How to design a generator and discriminator - in short a neural network - which can be used anywhere.

**Hackathon**
Participated in HackFrost 2024, came in the top 20 members for the Hackfrost promotional event on twitter and linkedin.


**Java Revision**
1. Created immutable class in java - asked in interviews , immutable means - its value cannot be changed.

Note- As you can see in the image the changed value of id is not shown - it prooves the immutability in java class created.
